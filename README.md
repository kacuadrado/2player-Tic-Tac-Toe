# 2player-Tic-Tac-Toe
Two player Tic-Tac-Toe designed and implemented in VHDL using the Vivado HLS software and Spartan-7 FPGA board.

This Tic-Tac-Toe program takes in as input the position (numbers 1 through 9 from keyboard assigned from top-left to bottom-right of the gameboard) of where the player wants to place their colored box. The other inputs are reset, mapped to the CPU RESET button in FPGA board, which clears the game board from all drawn boxes, and the system’s clock to be used by our PS/2 and VGA interfaces. This system assumes player one (blue) will place their box first. Once they have pressed the key corresponding to their desired position, an internal signal, which keeps track of which player’s turn it is, will be negated to allow the other player to place their colored box and so on. Internally, the system has assigned 9-bit signal/array for drawing the boxes to every 1-9 key. The way the system determines the color is by the internal signal that tracks the player’s turn as well as the 9-bit signals that determine which player has what colored box in the game board at the moment.. The final outputs of the system are VGA display (R, G, B, H and V signals) where the game board and boxes will be drawn, active-high LEDs 0-8 where the number of the key pressed will be displayed for debugging purposes and visual display, and the player’s turn (LED 15) where ON = player 1 and OFF = player 2.
